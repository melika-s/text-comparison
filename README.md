# text-comparison

I have two text files (both are poems written by Hafez). The code tries to find the similarity between these files and returns the cosine simillarity between them.

As time passed, the "stopwords_guilannlp" stopped working properly, therefore you need to use a file of persian stopwords (which you can find easily by googling) in order to be able to use the code for the persian texts.
